# Chinese-calligraphy-relief-modeling from single handwriting image
# We present a novel solution that enables fast modeling of Chinese calligraphy relief from 2D handwriting image, which benefits from the advances of deep learning. 
# The advantage over previous methods is that our method does not require parameter tuning and is fast in generating calligraphy reliefs from different resolution of inputs.
# For an input image with a resolution of 2432Ã—896, the modeling could be completed in less than two seconds.
# The codes and training dataset will be uploaded soon.
